Build an ML Pipeline for Short-Term Rental Prices in NYC
We have worked for a property management company renting rooms and properties for short periods of time on various rental platforms. we need to estimate the typical price for a given property based on the price of similar properties. My company receives new data in bulk every week. The model needs to be retrained with the same cadence, necessitating an end-to-end pipeline that can be reused.
